The MAGMA library number for G is  13 <br>
<H3> 
GrpPC : G of order 16 = 2^4
PC-Relations:
    G.3^2 = G.4, 
    G.2^G.1 = G.2 * G.4,

<br>
The order of the Frattini subgroup is  2 <br>

[ 8, 8, 8 ]
<br>
The orders of the normalizers of the maximal elementary abelian subgroups are  [
16, 16, 16 ]
<br>
<H3>The cohomology ring of G is the quotient of a polynomial 
ring in the variables  [
    z,
    y,
    x,
    w
]
 in degrees  [ 1, 1, 1, 4 ]

by the ideal generated by the relations <br> [
    z*y + y*x + x^2,
    z*x^2 + y*x^2 + x^3
]

The Hilbert series for the cohomology ring is  (t^2 + t + 1)/(t^4 - 2*t^3 + 
    2*t^2 - 2*t + 1)
<br>
Its numerator factors as 
( t^2 + t + 1
)
<br>
Its denominator factors as 
( t - 1
)^2
( t^2 + 1
)^1
<br><br>
The Krull dimension of the cohomology ring is  2 <br>
 The cohomology ring is Cohen-Macaulay and the longest regular sequence consists
of the generators [
    w,
    z^2 + y^2
]
