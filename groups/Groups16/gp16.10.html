<br>
The order of the Frattini subgroup is  4 <br>
The exponent of G is  4 <br>
G has a unique maximal elementary abelian subgroup which is central in 
G and has order  4 <br>
<H3>The cohomology ring of G is the quotient of a polynomial 
ring in the variables  [

The Hilbert series for the cohomology ring is  1/(t^2 - 2*t + 1)
<br>
Its denominator factors as
