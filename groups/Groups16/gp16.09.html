<H1><dd>GROUP OF ORDER 16 # 9 </H1>
The MAGMA library number for G is  3 <br>
<H3> 
GrpPC : G of order 16 = 2^4
PC-Relations:
    G.1^2 = G.3, 
    G.2^G.1 = G.2 * G.4
</H3>
The center of G is abelian of type  [ 2, 2 ]
<br>
The orders of the terms of the lower central series are  [ 16, 2, 1 ]
<br>
The orders of the terms of the upper central series are  [ 1, 4, 16 ]
<br>
The order of the Frattini subgroup is  4 <br>
The exponent of G is  4 <br>
G has a unique maximal elementary abelian subgroup which is normal and
has order  8. Its centralizer has order  8 <br>
<H3>The cohomology ring of G is the quotient of a polynomial 
ring in the variables  [
    z,
    y,
    x,
    w,
    v
]
 in degrees  [ 1, 1, 2, 2, 2 ]

by the ideal generated by the relations <br> [
    z^2,
    z*y,
    z*x,
    y^2*w + x^2
]
</h3>
The Hilbert series for the cohomology ring is  -1/(t^4 - 2*t^3 + 2*t - 1)
<br>
Its denominator factors as 
( t - 1
)^3
( t + 1
)^1
<br><br>
The Krull dimension of the cohomology ring is  3 <br>
 The longest regular sequence consists of the generators [
    w,
    v
]
<br>
 A homogeneous set of parameters is the set  [
    w,
    v,
    y^2
]
 of degrees  [ 2, 2, 2 ]
