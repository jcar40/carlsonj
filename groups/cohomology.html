<H2><dd><dd> Description of Project </H2>
<p>The goal is to compute as many examples as possible of mod-p 
cohomology rings of finite p-groups. In the early stages we have looked 
at the groups of order 64, as the groups of order 32 have been 
done [R]. Ultimately we would like to calculate the cohomology of 
larger 2-groups, of other p-groups for odd primes p and to use the 
information to calculate the cohomology rings of finite groups other 
than p-groups. Some of the last has already been done (e.g. see [CMM]). 
If there is anyone else who has calculations that they would like to 
make public then I would be happy to post the files on my server or to 
establish links to other web pages as appropriate. </p>

<p>The calculations on the sloth run in essentially two stages. The 
first is all groups, modules and linear algebra, The second stage is all 
Gr&ouml;bner basis and commutative algebra calculations. First of all the 
groups are called out of the library on MAGMA. For each group the 
MAGMA library number is given though the group is posted according 
to its HALL-SENIOR number (see [HaSe]). Some routine information 
about each group is computed and printed. After that the actual 
calculation of the cohomology begins. For notation let <i>G</i> denote 
the group and let <i>k</i> be the prime field F<sub>2</sub>. 

<h3>STAGE 1: Modules and Linear Algebra</h3>
<h4>Projective Resolutions</h4>
<p>  The first step is the computation of a standard free module 
for the group algebra. In particular, matrices for the action of 
a minimal set of generators for <i>G</i> and also for a power 
commutator set of generators for <i>G</i> on the free module <i>kG</i> are 
fixed. In this way the programs can rely almost entirely on linear 
algebra. That is, the more time consuming module theoretic machinery 
is used only at the beginning. Next a minimal projective resolution 
of the trivial module is computed and stored. Because the rate of 
growth (complexity) of the projective resolution is related to the 
<i>2</i>-rank of <i>G</i> the number of steps that were computed 
for each resolution varied according to the following formula.</p>

<Ul>For groups of <i>2</i>-rank 1, 2 or 3, sixteen steps were computed.</ul>

<Ul>For groups of <i>2</i>-rank 4, thirteen steps were computed.</ul>

<Ul>For groups of <i>2</i>-rank 5, ten steps were computed.</ul>

<Ul>For abelian groups only three steps were computed.</ul>

<p>Of course, the point about abelian groups is that the cohomology 
rings are generated in degrees 1 and 2 and the relations are well known.
One justification for this scheme is that for groups of large 
<i>2</i>-rank, the elements in a system of parameters will lie in low 
degrees. That is, it can be predicted that if <i>G</i> has order 64 and 
<i>2</i>-rank 4 then the elements in a system of parameters will lie 
in degree 4 or less. If the <i>2</i>-rank is 5 the parameters will 
lie in degree 2 or less. This can be proved using norm maps.</p>

<h4> ChainMaps </h4>
<p>Once the projective resolution is obtained the computer begins 
constructing chain maps for the cohomology generators. This is a 
careful process and no excess generators are computed. That is, the 
cup product of any two cohomology elements is obtained as the 
composition of the corresponding chain maps. The program computes 
some of the products as it goes and hence the only generators for 
which the chain maps are calculated are those which are not polynomials 
in the other generators. The printed output of this stage of the 
program is a list of the generators and a list of their degrees.</p>

<h4>Relations</h4>
<p>Following the chain map calculation we get the relations among the 
generators. That is, for a degree <i>n</i>, within the range of the 
computation, all possible monomials of degree <i>n</i> in the 
generators are computed. Each such monomial is a <i>k</i>-homomorphism 
from the <i>n<sup>th</sup></i> term, modulo its radical, in the projective 
resolution into <i>k</i>. Thus the set of relations among the monomials 
is the null space of the matrix whose rows are the matrices of these homomorphisms. Hence we have determined all possible relations of 
degree <i>n</i> in the generators. Of course this information is too 
massive to be helpful. What we really want is a minimal set of generators 
for the ideal of relations. To get the ideal we need to call upon the 
Gr&ouml;bner basis machinery. Hence we are led to Stage 2. The program 
actually produces a minimal set of generators for the ideal of 
relations. The notation is taken directly from the output from MAGMA. 
Hence "*" means multiplication and "^n" means n<sup>th</sup> power.</p>

<h3>STAGE 2: Commutative Algebra</h3>
<p> Once a minimal set of relations has been presented then the computation 
of the cohomology ring is (probably!) complete. The problem now is to 
prove it is complete. In [Test] we provide a scheme for the proof. All 
of this is based on conjectures about the nature of mod-p cohomology 
rings, but the fortunate thing is that the conjectures can be checked 
from the output of the computation. From here until the end, all of the 
calculations are entirely within the domain of the commutative algebra 
packages on MAGMA. 

<H4>Systems of Parameters and Regular Sequences</H4> 

<P> The Hilbert series for the cohomology ring and the factorizations 
of its numerator and denominator are given. This computation required 
only slight modification of existing algorithms.</p>

<P> A system of parameters for <i>H<sup>*</sup>(G, k)</i> is a 
collection of elements, <i>x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>r</sub></i> 
with the property they generate a polynomial subring of the cohomology 
ring for <i>H<sup>*</sup>(G, k)</i> and moreover the cohomology ring 
is a finitely generated module over that polynomial subring. Hence it 
is necessary that <i>r</i> be equal to the 2-rank of <i>G</i> which is 
the Krull dimension of the cohomology ring of 
<i>H<sup>*</sup>(G, k)</i>. The program then finds the depth of the 
cohomology ring by computing the longest regular sequence. There are 
some problems with the implementation of this routine which are noted 
below in the section on problems. However the accuracy of the 
calculation is verified in the next calculation. </P>

<h4> The hypercohomology Spectral Sequence </h4>
<p> The hypercohomology spectral sequence is described in detail 
in the paper [BC] (see also [Test]). It is a spectral sequence whose 
E<sub>2</sub> page is the Koszul complex of 
<i>H<sup>*</sup>(G, k)</i> with respect to the system of parameters 
chosen above. What is actually printed is the homology of the Koszul 
complex. In the event that the cohomology ring is Cohen-Macaulay the 
spectral sequence plays no part in the test for the completion of the calculation and is omitted. In this case the homology would all exist 
on the bottom row (Row 0). In the event that the depth of the 
cohomology ring is one less than the Krull dimension then the homology 
of the Koszul complex lies on two rows. The bottom row (Row 0) is 
presented by giving bases of the vector spaces of the homogeneous 
parts of the ring <i>H<sup>*</sup>(G, k)/x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>r</sub> 
</I>. The bases for this row and the others are presented by degrees. 
That is the output </p>
<ul><i>ROW 0:[z,x,w][z*x,u] ... </i></ul>
<P>would indicate that the space in degree one has basis consisting 
of the elements <i>z, x,</i> and <i>w</i>, the space in degree two 
has basis consisting of <i>zx</i> and <i>u</i>, etc. The symbol [] 
is to be interpreted as indicating that the space is the zero space.</P>

<h4> Restrictions to Elementary Abelian Subgroups </h4>
<p>The celebrated theorem of Quillen [Q] tells us that the minimal 
primes of the cohomology ring <i>H<sup>*</sup>(G, k)</i> are the 
radicals of the kernels of restrictions to the conjugacy classes of
maximal elementary abelian p-subgroups of <i>G</i>. Because we are 
only dealing with the case <i>p = 2</i> the cohomology rings of the 
elementary abelian p-subgroups are in fact integral domains and hence 
the minimal primes of the cohomology rings of <i>G</i> are the kernels of restrictions. The restriction map programs are described briefly in 
[CMM]. A complete list of representatives of the maximal elementary 
abelian subgroups was computed as part of the early information on 
the group. In this section is listed the representative, the 
images of the generators for the cohomology of <i>G</i> as elements 
in the polynomial ring which is the cohomology of the elementary abelian subgroup, and a list of the generators of the kernel of the 
restriction map.</p>

<p>The intersection of the minimal primes is the nilradical of the 
cohomology ring. In the event that this intersection is equal to the 
ideal of relations of the cohomology ring of <i>G</i> then the output 
of the program is the statement the the nilradical of the cohomology 
ring is zero. Otherwise the program prints a list of generators for 
the nilradical (intersection of the minimal primes) that are not in 
the ideal of relations for the cohomology ring.</p>

<h4>Restriction to Maximal Subgroups.</H4>
<p>A standard routine in MAGMA computes the maximal subgroups of 
the group <i>G</i>. Then these subgroups are matched with the 
isomorphic subgroups of order 32. Note that if the subgroup is 
abelian then the cohomology of the subgroup is known from the 
structure of the group. The cohomology ring of the subgroup is 
then computed out to the maximum of the degrees of the generators 
of <i>H<sup>*</sup>(G, k)</i>. This is for the purposes of computing 
the images of the generators of <i>H<sup>*</sup>(G, k)</i> under
 the restriction map and also for computing the kernel of the 
restriction. If the subgroup is not abelian then the cohomology 
ring of the subgroup is pulled from the record of the cohomology 
rings of the groups of order 32. Using the constructed isomorphism 
of the subgroup with the group of the record the restriction map 
is created and the images of the generators of <i>H<sup>*</sup>(G, k)
</i> in the cohomology ring of the subgroup are determined. Also 
the kernel of the restriction map is computed. 

<H4>Essential Cohomology</h4>
<p>The intersections of the kernels of restriction to the maximal 
subgroups is known as the essential cohomology. This ideal is 
constructed using the commutative algebra capabilities in MAGMA. 
The conjecture in [Test] is that the essential cohomology is nonzero 
only if the depth of the cohomology ring <i>H<sup>*</sup>(G, k)</i> 
is equal to the p-rank of the center of <i>G</i>. Moreover in the 
case that the essential cohomology is nonzero then it is further 
conjectured that it is a finitely generated free module over the 
polynomial subring <i>Q</i> generated by the elements of the 
longest regular sequence in <i>H<sup>*</sup>(G, k)</i>. The finitely 
generated part of this last question is easily checked by testing 
the dimension of the ideal of the essential cohomology using 
routines which are built into MAGMA. That is, if the dimension of 
the ideal of the essential cohomology is equal to the p-rank of 
the center of <i>G</i>, then it is also equal to the length of the 
longest regular sequence by Duflot's Theorem [Du]. A positive answer
to the conjecture would also lend evidence for some of the 
speculation in [Dep]. A test to show that the essential cohomology 
is a free module over <i>Q</i> seems to be much more difficult and 
may be beyond reason at this point. The computer program runs a 
check on this by seeing if the generators for the essential 
cohomology over <i>Q</i> are also generators for the cohomology 
ring <i>H<sup>*</sup>(G, k)</i> as a module over <i>Q</i>. This guarantees 
the free module property because it is known from commutative 
algebra (in the case that p-rank = depth) that the whole cohomology 
ring is a free module over <i>Q</i>. However the failure of the 
check does not mean that the conjecture is false. We say more 
about this below. </p>

<h3>Flags</h3>
In the course of the calculation certain flags have been set which 
record some of the information about the cohomology rings. Some of 
these are necessary for the proof that the calculation is compete 
and a complete set of generators and relations for the cohomology 
ring have been generated. The flags and their meanings are given 
below. Some of the flags are meant to draw attention to undesirable 
aspects of the calculation.<P>

<h4>Paramflag</h4>
<p>The paramflag is true if the computed system of parameters restricts 
to every elementary abelian subgroup as a system of parameters, or 
at least the cohomology ring of the elementary abelian subgroup is 
a finitely generated module over the subring generated by the 
restrictions of the elements in the system of parameters. Hence 
if the paramflag is true then we are guaranteed that the computed 
system of parameters is really a system of parameters for the 
cohomology ring. This check is an essential 
ingredient in the test for completion. </p>
<h4>Qregflag</h4>
<p>If the qregflag is true then the computed system of parameters 
is a quasiregular sequence (see [BC] or [Test]) for the computed 
cohomology ring. That is if, <i>x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>r</sub></i> 
is a system of parameters for the computed cohomology ring <i>R</i> 
then for each <i>i</i> we have that multiplication by <i>x<sub>i</sub></i> 
on <i>R/(x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>i-1</sub></i>) at least 
in degrees larger than, <i>deg(x<sub>1</sub>)+ ...+deg(x<sub>r</sub>)</i>. 
This check is an essential ingredient in the test for completion. </p>
<H4>Cmflag</h4>
<p> The cmflag is true if the cohomology ring is Cohen-Macaulay. 
This is not really a part of the test for completion.</p>
<h4>Essflag</h4>
<p>The essflag is true if the essential cohomology is zero. In the 
case that the essential cohomology is not zero then the essflag is 
still true provided the the annihilator of the essential cohomology 
has dimension equal to the p-rank of the center of the group. 
This would imply that the essential cohomology is a finitely 
generated module over the polynomial subring <i>Q</i> of the 
cohomology ring generated by a regular sequence of maximal length. 
There is one further check that is run in the case that the
essential cohomology is nonzero and its annihilator has the 
right dimension. That is, we check to see if the generators of 
the essential cohomology as a module over <i>Q</i> are also free 
generators of the cohomology ring as a module over <i>Q</i>. A 
failure of this last check does not mean that the essential 
cohomology is not a free module over <i>Q</i>. But at this point 
some hand checking is necessary.  This check is an essential 
ingredient in the test for completion.</P>
<H4>Centflag</h4>
<p>The centflag is true is the essential cohomology is zero or if 
the annihilator of the essential cohomology has dimension larger 
than the p-rank of the center of the group. If neither of these is 
true then the depth of the cohomology ring must be equal to the 
p-rank of the center. So it is important to be certain that the 
computed longest regular sequence for the cohomology ring is 
guaranteed to be a regular sequence. The check for this is to 
make sure that the restriction of these elements to the center 
of the group is a regular system of parameters. This check is 
an essential ingredient in the test for completion.</p>
<H4>Bigflag</h4>
<p> In order to keep the computations running the program instructed
 the machine not to perform certain kernel of restriction programs 
if the number of variables was too large. In such a case the bigflag 
was set at false. The negation does not imply that the computation is not 
complete, but only means that the test for completion has not 
been run. In the initial posting the computations with false 
bigflag were left out. We hope that advances in the techniques 
will eventually take care of all of these problems. </P>
<h4>Restrictflag</h4>
<p> The restrictflag is true as long as the ideal of relations for 
the cohomology ring is contained in all of the kernels of restriction. 
This flag is a check on the validity of the program itself and has 
nothing to do with the calculation. </P>
<h3>Problems</h3>
<p> Most of the problems related to the calculations are concerned 
with the commutative algebra operations. In this section I want to 
outline some of the difficulties that have been encountered and 
request help and suggestions from anyone who might know how some 
of these things should be handled. At some time, I hope to post a 
collection of challenge problems. These would mostly be problems 
that applications in MAGMA do not seem to be able to handle. Some 
of the Gr&ouml;bner basis calculations may simply be too large to do
with the present technology. Others might be possible with 
application of the right technique. I hope eventually to look 
at some of the stickier problems with other computer algebra
programs. It is a matter of finding the time to do it all. </P>

<h4>Choosing Variables</h4>
<p>The primary problem with the projective resolutions and chain 
maps is that there is a lot of randomness to the process which 
sets up the computation. One of the results is that the generators 
of the cohomology are sometimes not chosen in such a way as to make 
the relations as simple and compact as possible. It is clear 
from some of the examples that a simple change of variables would 
make the ideal of relations easier to understand. Of course, 
it would be possible to go through the entire set of groups and 
change the bases one by one. However such an exercise would be 
extremely tedious and I would much rather figure out a way to 
have it done automatically. While this may seem like it is only 
a problem of aesthetics, it may also have some bearing on the 
Gr&ouml;bner basis problems.</P>

<h4>Choosing Systems of Parameters</h4>
<p>The current algorithm (of my own writing) for choosing a system 
of parameters is simply a search in which the machine chooses 
polynomials, starting with the generators and proceeding up by 
degrees, and then testing to see if the Krull dimension of the 
ring drops when the polynomial is factored out. It continues 
until the Krull dimension becomes zero. For the purposes of the 
cohomology calculation this is reasonably satisfactory when it 
works and when it can find a system of parameters quickly. The 
problems with the technique are two-fold. Sometimes the search 
is extremely slow, particularly when the parameters cannot be 
found in low degrees and when there are many generators for the 
cohomology. This could possibly be cured by extending the field 
and/or using the theory to predict the degrees in which 
the parameters will be located. However the dimension test will 
run more slowly over a larger field. The second problem is that 
occasionally the output of the calculation is a system of
parameters which does not contain a regular sequence of maximal 
length. When this happens the calculation of the hypercohomology 
spectral sequence crashes. Again we could try extending the field 
with the obvious ill effect. </P>

<h4>Kernels of Restrictions</h4>
<p> The cohomology rings of the nonabelian groups of orders 8,16, 
and 32 are stored in a workspace which is loaded into MAGMA before 
the computations of the cohomology rings of the groups of order 
64 begin. So in particular, it is an easy matter to create a chain 
map which gives the restriction homomorphism for <i>G</i> to any 
of its subgroups. Obtaining the images of the generators of the 
cohomology for <i>G</i> is straightforward and runs in 
reasonable time. The difficulties start when we try to calculate 
the kernel of the restriction. This is, of course, an elimination 
ideal calculation, and such problems are known to be difficult. 
It has been noted in some examples that improvements in running 
time can be achieved by changing the ordering on the variables. 
However, most such improvements are made only on an <i>ad hoc</i> 
basis and I know of no general formula for dealing with the 
situation. This problem may turn out to be the most basic stumbling block to 
getting the cohomology rings of all of the groups of order 64.</P>
