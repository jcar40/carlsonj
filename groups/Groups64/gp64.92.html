G has a unique maximal elementary abelian subgroup which is central in 
G and has order  8 <br>
<H3>The cohomology ring of G is the quotient of a polynomial 
ring in the variables  [

The Hilbert series for the cohomology ring is  (-t^4 - 2*t^3 - t^2 - 2*t - 
    1)/(t^7 - t^6 - t^5 + t^4 - t^3 + t^2 + t - 1)
<br>
Its numerator factors as 
( t^4 + 2*t^3 + t^2 + 2*t + 1

)^3
( t + 1
)^2
( t^2 + 1
