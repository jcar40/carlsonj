The center of G is abelian of type  [ 2, 2 ]
<br>
The orders of the terms of the lower central series are  [ 64, 4, 2, 1 ]

<br>
The order of the Frattini subgroup is  8 <br>
The exponent of G is  8 <br>
G has a unique maximal elementary abelian subgroup which is central in 
G and has order  4 <br>
<H3>The cohomology ring of G is the quotient of a polynomial 
ring in the variables  [
    z,
    y,
    x,
    w,
    v
]
 in degrees  [ 1, 1, 1, 2, 4 ]

    z^2,
    z*y + z*x + y*x + x^2,
    y^3 + y^2*x + z*x^2 + x^3

The Hilbert series for the cohomology ring is  (t^2 + t + 1)/(t^4 - 2*t^3 + 
    2*t^2 - 2*t + 1)
<br>
Its numerator factors as 
( t^2 + t + 1
)

Its denominator factors as 
( t - 1
)^2
( t^2 + 1
)^1

The Krull dimension of the cohomology ring is  2 <br>
 The cohomology ring is Cohen-Macaulay and the longest regular sequence consists
of the generators [
