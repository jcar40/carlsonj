The center of G is abelian of type  [ 2, 2 ]

G has a unique maximal elementary abelian subgroup which is central in 
G and has order  4 <br>
<H3>The cohomology ring of G is the quotient of a polynomial 
ring in the variables  [

The Hilbert series for the cohomology ring is  (t^4 + t^3 + t^2 + t + 1)/(t^6 - 
    2*t^5 + 3*t^4 - 4*t^3 + 3*t^2 - 2*t + 1)

Its numerator factors as 
( t^4 + t^3 + t^2 + t + 1
)

Its denominator factors as 
( t - 1
)^2
( t^2 + 1
)^2
<br><br>
The Krull dimension of the cohomology ring is  2 <br>
 The cohomology ring is Cohen-Macaulay and the longest regular sequence consists
of the generators [
