The center of G is abelian of type  [ 2, 2 ]
<br>
The orders of the terms of the lower central series are  [ 64, 8, 4, 2, 1 ]
<br>
The orders of the terms of the upper central series are  [ 1, 4, 8, 16, 64 ]
<br>
The order of the Frattini subgroup is  16 <br>
The exponent of G is  16 <br>
G has one conjugate class of maximal elementary abelian subgroups. Any
element of the class has order  8 . Its centralizer 
has order  8  and its normalizer has order  16 <br>
<H3>The cohomology ring of G is the quotient of a polynomial 
ring in the variables  [
    z,
    y,
    x,
    w,
    v
]
 in degrees  [ 1, 1, 2, 2, 2 ]

    z*y + y^2,
    z*x + y*x,

The Hilbert series for the cohomology ring is  -1/(t^4 - 2*t^3 + 2*t - 1)
<br>
Its denominator factors as 
( t - 1
)^3
( t + 1
)^1
<br><br>
The Krull dimension of the cohomology ring is  3 <br>
 The longest regular sequence consists of the generators [
    w,
    v
]
<br>
 A homogeneous set of parameters is the set  [
    w,
    v,
    z^2
]
 of degrees  [ 2, 2, 2 ]
