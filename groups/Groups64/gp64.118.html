G has one conjugate class of maximal elementary abelian subgroups. Any
element of the class has order  8 . Its centralizer 
has order  16  and its normalizer has order  32 <br>
<H3>The cohomology ring of G is the quotient of a polynomial 
ring in the variables  [

The Hilbert series for the cohomology ring is  -1/(t^5 - 3*t^4 + 4*t^3 - 4*t^2 +
    3*t - 1)
<br>
Its denominator factors as 
( t - 1
)^3
( t^2 + 1
