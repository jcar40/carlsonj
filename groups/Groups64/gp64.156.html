The center of G is abelian of type  [ 2, 2 ]
<br>
The orders of the terms of the lower central series are  [ 64, 4, 1 ]
<br>
The orders of the terms of the upper central series are  [ 1, 4, 64 ]
<br>
The order of the Frattini subgroup is  4 <br>
The exponent of G is  4 <br>
G has a unique maximal elementary abelian subgroup which is central in 
G and has order  4 <br>
<H3>The cohomology ring of G is the quotient of a polynomial 
ring in the variables  [
    z,
    y,
    x,
    w,
    v,
    u
]
 in degrees  [ 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4 ]

    z^2 + z*x + z*w + y*w + x*w,
    y^2 + y*x + x^2 + x*w + w^2,
    x^3,
    x^2*w + x*w^2 + w^3
]
</h3>
The Hilbert series for the cohomology ring is  (t^4 + 2*t^3 + 3*t^2 + 2*t + 
    1)/(t^6 - 2*t^5 + 3*t^4 - 4*t^3 + 3*t^2 - 2*t + 1)
<br>
Its numerator factors as 
( t^2 + t + 1
)^2
<br>
Its denominator factors as 
( t - 1
)^2
( t^2 + 1
)^2
<br><br>
The Krull dimension of the cohomology ring is  2 <br>
 The cohomology ring is Cohen-Macaulay and the longest regular sequence consists
of the generators [
