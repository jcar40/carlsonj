<H3>The cohomology ring of G is the quotient of a polynomial 
ring in the variables  [
    z,
    y,
    x,
    w,
    v

 in degrees  [ 1, 1, 2, 2, 2 ]

by the ideal generated by the relations <br> [
    z^2,
    z*y,

The Hilbert series for the cohomology ring is  -1/(t^4 - 2*t^3 + 2*t - 1)
<br>
Its denominator factors as 
( t - 1
)^3
( t + 1
)^1

The Krull dimension of the cohomology ring is  3 <br>
 The longest regular sequence consists of the generators [
    w,
    v
]
<br>
 A homogeneous set of parameters is the set  [
    w,
    v,
    y^2
]
 of degrees  [ 2, 2, 2 ]
