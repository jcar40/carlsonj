<br>
The order of the Frattini subgroup is  8 <br>

G has  2  conjugacy classes of maximal elementary abelian p-subgroups. The 
orders of the maximal elementary abelian subgroups are  [ 8, 8 ]
<br>

<H3>The cohomology ring of G is the quotient of a polynomial 
ring in the variables  [
    z,
    y,
    x,
    w
]
 in degrees  [ 1, 1, 1, 2 ]

by the ideal generated by the relations <br> [
    z*y + y*x
]
</h3>
The Hilbert series for the cohomology ring is  -1/(t^3 - 3*t^2 + 3*t - 1)
<br>
Its denominator factors as 
( t - 1
)^3
<br><br>
The Krull dimension of the cohomology ring is  3 <br>
 The cohomology ring is Cohen-Macaulay and the longest regular sequence consists
of the generators [
    z^2,
    w,
    y^2 + y*x + x^2
]
