G has one conjugate class of maximal elementary abelian subgroups. Any
element of the class has order  8 . Its centralizer 
has order  8  and its normalizer has order  32 <br>
<H3>The cohomology ring of G is the quotient of a polynomial 
ring in the variables  [

The Hilbert series for the cohomology ring is  (t^3 - t - 1)/(t^6 - 2*t^5 + t^4 
    - t^2 + 2*t - 1)
<br>
Its numerator factors as 
( t^3 - t - 1
