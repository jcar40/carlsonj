The MAGMA library number for G is  56 <br>
<H3> 
GrpPC : G of order 64 = 2^6
PC-Relations:
    G.1^2 = G.3, 
    G.2^2 = G.4, 
    G.2^G.1 = G.2 * G.6
</H3>
The center of G is abelian of type  [ 2, 2, 2, 2 ]
<br>
The orders of the terms of the lower central series are  [ 64, 2, 1 ]
<br>
The orders of the terms of the upper central series are  [ 1, 16, 64 ]
<br>
The order of the Frattini subgroup is  8 <br>
The exponent of G is  4 <br>
G has a unique maximal elementary abelian subgroup which is central in 
G and has order  16 <br>
<H3>The cohomology ring of G is the quotient of a polynomial 
ring in the variables  [
    z,
    y,
    x,
    w,
    v,
    u,
    t,
    s
]
 in degrees  [ 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 ]

by the ideal generated by the relations <br> [
    z^2,
    z*y,
    y^2,
    z*w,
    y*w + z*u,
    y*u,
    w^2,
    w*u,
    u^2
]

The Hilbert series for the cohomology ring is  (t^2 + t + 1)/(t^6 - 2*t^5 - t^4 
    + 4*t^3 - t^2 - 2*t + 1)
<br>
Its numerator factors as 
( t^2 + t + 1
)
<br>
Its denominator factors as 
( t - 1
)^4
( t + 1
)^2
<br><br>
The Krull dimension of the cohomology ring is  4 <br>
 The cohomology ring is Cohen-Macaulay and the longest regular sequence consists
of the generators [
    x^2,
    v,
    t,
    s
]
