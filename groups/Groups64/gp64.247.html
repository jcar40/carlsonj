G has one conjugate class of maximal elementary abelian subgroups. Any
element of the class has order  8 . Its centralizer 
has order  8  and its normalizer has order  16 <br>
<H3>The cohomology ring of G is the quotient of a polynomial 
ring in the variables  [

The Hilbert series for the cohomology ring is  (-t^2 + t - 1)/(t^5 - 3*t^4 + 
    4*t^3 - 4*t^2 + 3*t - 1)
<br>
Its numerator factors as 
( t^2 - t + 1
)
<br>
Its denominator factors as 
( t - 1
)^3
( t^2 + 1
)^1
<br><br>
The Krull dimension of the cohomology ring is  3 <br>
 The longest regular sequence consists of the generators [
    s
]
<br>
 A homogeneous set of parameters is the set  [
    s,
    y^2,
    w
]
 of degrees  [ 4, 2, 2 ]
