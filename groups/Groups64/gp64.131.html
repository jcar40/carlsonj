The Hilbert series for the cohomology ring is  (t^2 - t + 1)/(t^7 - 3*t^6 + 
    3*t^5 - t^4 - t^3 + 3*t^2 - 3*t + 1)
<br>
Its numerator factors as 
( t^2 - t + 1
)
<br>
Its denominator factors as 
( t - 1
)^4
( t + 1
)^1
( t^2 + 1
)^1
<br><br>
The Krull dimension of the cohomology ring is  4 <br>
 The longest regular sequence consists of the generators [
    w,
    q
]
<br>
 A homogeneous set of parameters is the set  [
