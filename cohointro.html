<H1> <center> THE MOD-2 COHOMOLOGY OF 2-GROUPS  (by Jon Carlson)</center><br>
<cnter> THIRD RUN </center></H1>
<P> On this web page we present the data from the third run of the 
computer calculation of the mod-2 cohomology of groups of 
order 8, 16, 32 and 64. All of the calculations were made using 
the MAGMA computer algebra system. The groups 
are indexed by their Hall-Senior Numbers. </P>

The first run of the 
cohomology rings was terminated in July of 1997. The cohomology
rings of all but five of the groups of order 64 were successfully 
calculated. The failure to compute the last five were all due to 
problems with the Groebner basis machinery used to make minimal
sets of relations among the generators of the cohomology. To view the
results of the first run <a href= 
"http://www.math.uga.edu/~jfc/groups/cohomology.html"> 
click here.</a></p> 

The second attempt at the calculations was begun in February of 
1998. As of early November 1998,
all but six of the cohomology rings of the 267 groups of 
order 64 had been calculated. Some partial results had been 
posted for the cohomology rings of the remaining six groups. 
As in the first run the problems have been mostly in the 
Groebner basis computations. For the third run we wrote
programs that circumvented these problems.

results of the second run

The user should be warned at this stage that
the results of the computation on the third run will, in many cases,
not look like the results from the first or second runs. 
There are several probabilistic
elements in the calculation that cause different 
choices of variables for the cohomolgy rings in many of the 
calculations. The computed cohomology rings
from the first, second, and third runs will certainly be isomorphic, 
but direct 
comparisons cannot be made. </P>

<h2> New Features </h2>

In the third run we computed the transfer maps from maximal
subgroups.
We also calculated associated prime ideals
(for cohomology rings that are not Cohen-Macaulay).
For each group, we included a link to a text file,
readable by magma, with all the basic information about 
the cohomology of that group.</P>

<H3>Please send me your comments </H3>
<p>This web page is very experimental and is not likely to be refereed 
or reviewed by anyone except the users. Please feel free to <a href= 
"mailto:jfc@sloth.math.uga.edu">send me </a>any suggestions for 
improvement as well as any misprints or mistakes that you might notice.</p>

<H4>Equipment</H4>
<p>Most of the calculations that are posted were performed on an SUN 
ULTRA 60 Elite 3D, (toui). More notes on the details of the calculations are 
given below. I want to thank the National Science Foundation and 
University of Georgia Research Foundation for providing me with both 
the equipment and the time to work on this project.</p> 

<H4>Programs</H4>
<p>All of the programs are written in MAGMA code and run on the MAGMA 
platform. Thanks are due to John Cannon and Allan Steel of the MAGMA 
project for numerous instances of help with the tools to make the 
programs work and for their enthusiastic support. I  am currently working
on adaptations of the programs that will be suitable for inclusion in MAGMA
in the near future.   </p>
 
<h2>Some Interesting Features</h2>

<p>One of the aims of the project has been to test some of the 
conjectures and investigate some of the many questions related to the 
structure of group cohomology. Accordingly we point out a few of the
findings of the calculations. These are statements which hold for all
of the cohomology rings that have been calculated. It is likely that
there are many more interesting features that have not been observed 
in the limited time that we have had to examine the data. </p>

<ul>The maximum of the nilpotency degrees of any of the nilradicals 
of the cohomology rings is 7 (group number 108). Almost all of the
others are nilpotent of degree 5 or less. The nilradical of the 
cohomology ring of group nunber 79 is nilpotent of degree 6. <br></ul>

<ul>The nilpotency degree of the essential cohomology is never more
than 2. <br></ul>

<ul>The <i>depth-essential cohomology</i> in nonzero whenever the 
cohomology ring is not Cohen-Macaulay.<br></ul>

<ul>Moreover the annihilator of the depth-essential cohomology 
is an ideal whose variety in the maximal ideal spectrum of the cohomology 
ring has dimension equal to the depth of the cohomology ring. 
Equivalently, the quotient ring of the cohomology ring by the 
annihilator of the depth-essential cohomology has dimension equal
to the depth of the cohomology ring.<br> </ul>

<ul>In the cases that have been calculated, the depth-essential 
cohomology is a free module over the polynomial subring of the 
cohomology ring generated by the elements of a regular sequence of
maximal length. <br></ul>
 
<h3> I would be interested in knowing what other features of the 
calculation could be of use or interest for other researchers in the 
area.
I am sure that there are many other features worthy of 
calculation, and I would welcome suggestions of things to consider 
in the next run.</h3>
