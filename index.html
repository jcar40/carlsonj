I am emeritus professor of <a href="http://www.math.uga.edu">
Mathematics</a>  at <A HREF ="http://www.uga.edu">  <IMG align=middle

I have written some computer programs to compute the cohomology ring
of finite p-groups. To see some of the results of the third run on 
calculations of the cohomology rings 
<A HREF ="http://web.archive.org/web/20070703105251/http://www.math.uga.edu/~lvalero/cohointro.html">
click here</A>.
The results of the <A HREF 
="/groups/cohomology.html">
first run</A> 
and the <A HREF
="/groups2/cohomology2.html">
second run</A> are still available.

<P>
I have been using newly developed program for extracting generators
and relations for matrix algebras to compute the structure of Hecke
algebras for symmetric groups. To see the results 
<A HREF ="hecke.html">
click here</A>. Some computations of basic algebras of Schur algebras
have been added recently. The results can be found 
<A HREF ="schur.html"> here</A>.

Recently, I have added calculations of the Hecke algebras for the 
permutation modules which are the normalizers of Sylow subgroups. The
results are found by 
<A HREF ="hecken.html">
clicking here</A>.</P>


<P> 
My research interests are in Algebra/Group Theory.
