I have written some computer programs to compute the cohomology ring of 
finite 2-groups, as well as (with Graham Matthews) the basic algebras of 
matrix algebras. The matrix algebras packages have been used to compute
the basic algebras of Hecke algebras and Schur Algebras. Some of 
these computations are posted here. In particular, we offer the following.

These calculations were made with the assistence of Luis Valero-Elizondo and
Mucheng Zhang. They give the cohomology ring of all group 2-groups of order
up to 64, including information on maximal ideals, inflations from maximal
quotient groups, restrictions to elementary abelian and maximal subgroups.
Unfortunatly, the original source of these files were lost during a change 
in computer systems at the University of Georgia. The pages offered here rely 
on the archive of the WAYBACK machine. One result is that some information 
may be missing. Some effort is being made to reconstruct
the original version. Progress will be reported. 
A complete printed version of the computations 
is in the appendix to the book

The files present computations of information on the  basic algbras
of Schur algebras over finite fields. 
It includes such things as the structure of the projective indecompoables,
Cartan matrix and blocks.

The files give basic information of the endomorphism rings of Young
modules for the group algebras over finite fields of some symmetric groups
