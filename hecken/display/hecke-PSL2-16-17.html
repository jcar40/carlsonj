The module M is the permutation module over the
field of chacteristic 17, having point stablilizer
of order 34
. The dimension of M is  120
. <br><br>
The dimensions of the irreducible submodules are

.<br><br>
The module is semi-simple. It has composition factors consisting of the 
modules 1, 2, 3, 4.

The action algebra A is the image of kG in the 
k-endomorphism ring of M. It's simple modules are the irreducible
submodules of M.
